      We generally separate out recruitment of students by whether they already have funding or not. We prioritize students who already have funding, especially as research funding is changing where even funded projects can be dropped, delayed, or changed with almost no notice. That said, we usually have 3 to 5 positions that we must fill every year.

### Undergraduate Positions

<!-- UNDERGRADUATE POSITIONS -->

  <ul>
    <li> 
      Development of an automated high-speed off-road dune buggy. Students are needed who can do CAD, install wiring and electronics, program embedded systems (Arduino, Teensy, NVDIA Jetson-Orin), process data, and write publications. Honors thesis students have used this platform repeatedly for their work. Primary goals include:
      * Developing algorithms that remember previous off-road paths and can replay them if communication is lost to the driver
      * Assisting the driver by handling speed control whereas the driver performs steering
      * Automating collision avoidance
      * Developing automatic throttle control systems so that the vehicle will not flip when in mid-air, during a jump.

### Graduate Positions

<!-- GRADUATE POSITIONS -->
<details open>
  <summary> Click to see/unsee </summary>
  <ul>
    <li> 
     Measurement of road friction by dedicated vehicles, processing of data in a central database, and coordinating data to road users and road maintenance. This project needs students who will:
      * Develop hardware systems (encoders and DGPS) to measure wheel slip of highway vehicles, deploy these systems on moving vehicles, and process data. Skills needed include MATLAB, hardware fabrication, ROS, signals and systems knowledge.
      * Collecting data from a fleet of vehicles (approximately 50,000) to obtain road friction information across all of Pennsylvania. Skills needed include: AWS server deployment, SQL (PostGres), strong statistics knowledge      
      * Automating the data processing and data collection steps. Skills needed include MATLAB, Python, expert-level statistics and dynamics (Kalman filtering, ANOVA, AVAR)
